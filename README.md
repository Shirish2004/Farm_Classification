README
This Jupyter Notebook contains a project that uses machine learning techniques to classify strawberry farms based on their visual characteristics using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Project Description
The project aims to classify different strawberry farms based on their visual features such as size, shape, and color using a CNN model. The dataset used in this project contains images of different strawberry farms captured using a drone. The images are preprocessed to improve the quality of the dataset, and then the CNN model is trained on this dataset to classify the farms into different categories. There are 4 .ipynb files one to create dataset titled as Dataset_Creation, Another simply applies a CNN model for classification, CNN_optimization shows code for optimizing the architecture and some implementation of feature extraction the final Notebook titled Final_Classification classifies the images using optimized cnn model, classification using machine learning and feature extraction. Running all notebooks follow the same procedure and the final results have been displayed in the final_classification notebook

Installation

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Optuna

You can install these packages using pip or conda:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn optuna

or

conda install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn optuna

Usage

To use these Jupyter Notebook, you can simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in sequence. The notebook is designed to guide you through the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
You will need to download the dataset, which is provided in the form of a ZIP file. Extract the ZIP file to a local directory and update the file path in the notebook to point to the extracted directory.

Conclusion

The proposed CNN-based classification model can be used for accurate and efficient classification of strawberry farms, which can help farmers in decision-making and yield optimization.
